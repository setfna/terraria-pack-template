English - en-US.json
German - de-DE.json

French - fr-FR.json

Now, an example

{
    "ItemName": {
        "CopperShortsword": "Overpowered Sword",
        "ToiletCactus": "Nightmare Toilet",
        "Wood": "Lumber",
    },
    "ItemTooltip": {
        "ToiletCactus": "'This is going to be a huge mistake.'",
        "Gel": "'Do not consume while on fire.'",
    }
}
in this case, we opened 2 categories, the "ItemName" category and the "ItemTooltip" category.
In these categories, they will each change something.
ItemName will change the Item's Name.
ItemTooltip will change the flavor text.
What we did was:
*We opened the ItemName category
*We changed the name of the item from "CopperShortsword" to "Overpowered Sword"
*We changed the name of the item from "ToiletCactus" to "Nightmare Toilet"
*We changed the name "Wood" to "Lumber"
*We Opened the category ItemTooltip
*We changed the ToiletCactus flavor text to "This is going to be a huge mistake."
*
